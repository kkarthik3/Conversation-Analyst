We feel it is a significant breakthrough and will \\nbe the India's first indigenous developed and manufactured cell therapy product for treating \\ncertain blood cancers. \\nThe second one is initiation of GLP Lab Construction for the manufacture of viral vectors and \\ngene therapy products at IIT, Kanpur.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nThe third one is increase in our stake in Laurus Bio, now 88%. This is a reflection to our \\nconfidence on great potential for future developments in enzyme technology platform. \\nCurrently, it's an exciting time at Laurus labs and we are determined to build on our R&D-driven \\ncommercial excellence to deliver best quality and affordable healthcare solutions as we seek to \\ncreate a long-term value for both patients and our all stakeholders. \\nOur Q2 results is in line and improved over Q1 due to recovery in customer supplies, which is \\ndriving higher revenues. While gross margins were maintained at very healthy level, our \\nEBITDA margins have clocked a modest recovery as higher upfront expenses and growth \\nprojects have weighed on our overall operating cost. It is important to keep in mind as well as \\nthat our year-on-year growth was subdued due to particularly strong quarter we had in FY23. \\nAs a result of these factors, our revenues were declined by 22% to Rs.1,224 crores and EBITDA \\ncame at Rs.188 crores with a margin of 15.4%. Our quarter-on-quarter growth is rebounding in \\nboth our API and formulations business, supported by strong underlying demand in other \\nsegments. \\nOur CDMO business project pipeline have continued to scale up along with the expansion of \\nour new partnerships. Our cost improvement programs are also progressing as expected. \\nFollowing the recovery, we saw in Q2, we remain optimistic for a better H2 resulting from both \\nhealthy order book and strong commercialization capabilities. \\nTo begin, I would like to share key updates on our formulations business. Our formulations \\ndivision reported overall revenues of Rs.332 crores for Q2, increasing over 120%. That was \\nbecause of low base last year. On sequential basis revenues have also improved by 16%. \\nMoreover, if you look at our H1, revenues increased by 24%. This was primarily driven by \\nrecovery in every business along with growth in our developed market share. \\nComing to LMIC business, overall market volumes have largely remained stable, partly \\nsupported from stable prices. We remain fully committed to stabilize our ARV franchise \\nbusiness throughout the FY24 and beyond while navigating the pricing headwinds. \\nWe awarded with 20% recent NACO tender for a supply of key products and this is our maiden \\nsuccessful bid in the Government of India tender for the supplies of HIV products in India. This \\nwas achieved primarily because of our fully backward integrated offering in ARV model. \\nWe have successfully implemented several cost improvement measures and we believe these \\nmeasures will sufficiently ensure our market readiness and confidence of sustaining leadership \\nposition in first line ARV treatment both in APIs and formulations. \\nComing to the developed markets, demand for our broader portfolio remain healthy. In US, we \\ncontinue to get good market share on several products and also increasing volumes.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nDuring H1, we filed one ANDA. Cumulatively, we have filed total 38 ANDAs to-date. Of this, \\nwe have 15 final approvals and 13 tentative approvals so far. \\nWe continue to have diverse portfolio and pipeline including novel 505(b)2 products comprising \\nof ARV, cardiovascular, diabetes, CNS, and gastrointestinal. \\nIn Canada, we have 21 filings with 13 product approvals, of which we have launched nine \\nproducts and we are intending to launch at least two more products during the second-half of \\nFY24. \\nFor EU markets, we have 18 filings with 14 product approvals, of which we already launched \\nsix products. We have continued to strengthen our CMO relationships and anticipate further \\nvolume increases in the coming quarters. \\nOur FDF division continue to operate most of the total commission capacity of 10 billion, in \\nwhich we anticipate that the remaining Brownfield capacities that we added in the last year \\nshould start to get optimally utilized by end of this year. \\nOn R&D front, overall R&D spending to sales for H1 FY24 was at 4.5%. We have incurred little \\nhigher R&D expenditure in this quarter as we acquired intellectual rights for few gene therapy \\nproducts from IIT, Kanpur. \\nWe continue to make good progress and invest in portfolio with product-specific approach based \\non complexity and scale economics. \\nWe have total 62 products in R&D pipeline with market size of over US$ 49 billion. \\nI would like to share the status of our filings as of now; 38 ANDAs in the US, 18 dossiers in \\nEurope, 21 products in Canada, nine dossiers with WSO, eight dossiers in South Africa, one in. \\nAustralia, while 20 dossiers filed in India, while several products were filed in various ROW \\nmarkets. \\nOverall R&D to sales of the full year is expected to be around 4.5%. \\nWhile coming to generic APIs, revenue from generic APIs during the Q2 declined by 8% year-\\non-year to Rs.629 crores. However, sequentially, it has improved by 5%. For H1, overall growth \\nwas flattish. \\nARV retained its volume-led steady momentum through Q2 and revenues moderated a bit, \\nattributing to an element of cyclicality in the ordering. \\nWe continue to maintain a leading market share in the first line HIV treatment-related APIs.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nIn the onco API space, the sales for the quarter rebounded and delivered a strong revenue \\nincrease over 100% year-on-year to Rs.117 crores. In H1, the growth is over 50%. This is \\nreflective of strong demand across our portfolio and favorable industry dynamics. We are \\naugmenting the new capacity for oncology products to accommodate the increased demand. \\nMore importantly, Laurus Labs, one of the largest high potent API capacities in the country. And \\nour aim to strengthen global leadership in some of the existing products by focusing on higher \\nvolumes and adding new potent molecules. \\nIn the other API segment, which includes cardiovascular, diabetes, asthma has slightly \\nrecovered, tracking only 2% growth quarter-on-quarter to Rs.139 crores. Recovery is muted on \\naccount of temporary market dynamics and scheduling patterns from our partners. On the year-\\non-year basis, revenues declined by 37%. We are confident that underlying demand for our \\nproducts remain strong and our CMO order book has continued to look very healthy. \\nIn first half this financial year, we have filed three DMF, out of those two are in non-ARV \\ncategory. With this company has a total of 83 DMF. \\nWhile coming to synthesis business during the Q2, the company CDMO business recorded \\nrevenues of Rs.224 crores, decline of almost 70% year-on-year. The revenues declined due to a \\nweak year-on-year comparison given large CDMO projects executed last year. Otherwise, the \\nbaseline business tracking healthy and project pipeline continues to scale up very well with our \\nexisting and new customers added in the last six months. \\nWe continue to execute on our scientific-led approach to customer acquisition and retention. We \\nare further strengthening and expanding our relationship with several big pharma. \\nWe remain focused on improving our integrated CDMO enabling technology platform to \\nachieve diversified revenue stream, ensuring stability and resilience. \\nWe are working on over 60 projects, out of this, there are 10 products, commercial, few APIs \\nand several intermediates. \\nWe made good progress on new science for CDMO division, both R&D Center and \\nmanufacturing facilities under LSPL. \\nOur animal health unit initiated commercial validations from this month and should gradually \\nscale up. R&D center is likely to get commissioned by the end of FY24. Our new animal health \\nsite will have all the capabilities to handle steroids, hormones and high potent molecules apart \\nfrom other large volume products. \\nIn Laurus Bio, we recorded strong growth for Q2 and H1; Q2 we grew the revenues by 44% and \\nH1 by 56%. The growth was led by attraction in CDMO services along with the expansion in\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nour customer base. We're also optimizing our capacities with the large scale CDMO partners and \\nexpect increased downstream capacity to come on line by December '23. This unit will achieve \\nits peak revenues during FY25. \\nOur enhanced technical expertise and biocatalysis is expanding its application in several small \\nmolecule manufacturing where Laurus is utilizing this expertise to service big pharma. \\nProgress on our new Greenfield site at R3 is on track and we have completed the design phase. \\nWe expect the expansion to happen in a phased manner. This site should further strengthen \\nLaurus capabilities in offering CDMO services in animal origin free proteins and growth factors \\napart from large scale permutation. \\nLet me share brief on quality and EHS initiatives. We have continued to implement and operate \\nbest-in-class R&D, manufacturing and quality control systems in line with the highest global \\nstandards along with a comprehensive EHS management. This is enabled by our profound \\nscientific team of over 2,300 people embracing commitment to evolve to address new \\nopportunities. \\nDuring Q2, we implemented the project called “Sankalp” in association with DuPont \\nSustainability Solutions to further enhance organizational safety excellence. \\nDuring the H1 FY24, a total of 51 quality audits were undertaken, including several customer \\naudits. To-date since inception we have successfully passed 91 regulatory audits, including 40  \\naudits from major global regulatory agencies like USFDA, WHO, PMDA, TGA, EMA and \\nMHRA. \\nWith that, I would like to hand it over to Ravi to share some of the financial highlights.\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'speaker': 'Dr. Satyanarayana Chava', 'order': 2}, page_content=\"Thank you, Monish for hosting this conference call. Thank you for joining us for our Q2 & H1 \\nFY24 Results Conference Call. We're pleased to have this opportunity to update you on our \\nprogress and answer your questions. \\nOur performance from Q2 started to see improvement and our priorities remain consistent. By \\nfocusing on R&D-led commercial strategy and customer-centric business orientation, we're \\nadvancing and augmenting our operational excellence to offer cutting-edge technology \\nplatforms in the manufacturing of small molecules, deliver the best external and internal \\nopportunities as well as bringing innovative manufacturing solutions to companies and patients. \\nWe've executed on several important business development transactions last quarter and we are \\nfurther accelerating our strategic manufacturing partnerships. \\nWe're also pleased to report that our investment into disruptive technology is progressing well. \\nThe first one is our investment in ImmunoACT CAR-T lead compound. NexCAR-19, which \\ncompleted Phase-II trial for lymphoma and leukemia indication, has been granted marketing \\napproval from CDSCO, Government of India. We feel it is a significant breakthrough and will \\nbe the India's first indigenous developed and manufactured cell therapy product for treating \\ncertain blood cancers. \\nThe second one is initiation of GLP Lab Construction for the manufacture of viral vectors and \\ngene therapy products at IIT, Kanpur.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nThe third one is increase in our stake in Laurus Bio, now 88%. This is a reflection to our \\nconfidence on great potential for future developments in enzyme technology platform. \\nCurrently, it's an exciting time at Laurus labs and we are determined to build on our R&D-driven \\ncommercial excellence to deliver best quality and affordable healthcare solutions as we seek to \\ncreate a long-term value for both patients and our all stakeholders. \\nOur Q2 results is in line and improved over Q1 due to recovery in customer supplies, which is \\ndriving higher revenues. While gross margins were maintained at very healthy level, our \\nEBITDA margins have clocked a modest recovery as higher upfront expenses and growth \\nprojects have weighed on our overall operating cost. It is important to keep in mind as well as \\nthat our year-on-year growth was subdued due to particularly strong quarter we had in FY23. \\nAs a result of these factors, our revenues were declined by 22% to Rs.1,224 crores and EBITDA \\ncame at Rs.188 crores with a margin of 15.4%. Our quarter-on-quarter growth is rebounding in \\nboth our API and formulations business, supported by strong underlying demand in other \\nsegments. \\nOur CDMO business project pipeline have continued to scale up along with the expansion of \\nour new partnerships. Our cost improvement programs are also progressing as expected. \\nFollowing the recovery, we saw in Q2, we remain optimistic for a better H2 resulting from both \\nhealthy order book and strong commercialization capabilities. \\nTo begin, I would like to share key updates on our formulations business. Our formulations \\ndivision reported overall revenues of Rs.332 crores for Q2, increasing over 120%. That was \\nbecause of low base last year. On sequential basis revenues have also improved by 16%. \\nMoreover, if you look at our H1, revenues increased by 24%. This was primarily driven by \\nrecovery in every business along with growth in our developed market share. \\nComing to LMIC business, overall market volumes have largely remained stable, partly \\nsupported from stable prices. We remain fully committed to stabilize our ARV franchise \\nbusiness throughout the FY24 and beyond while navigating the pricing headwinds. \\nWe awarded with 20% recent NACO tender for a supply of key products and this is our maiden \\nsuccessful bid in the Government of India tender for the supplies of HIV products in India. This \\nwas achieved primarily because of our fully backward integrated offering in ARV model. \\nWe have successfully implemented several cost improvement measures and we believe these \\nmeasures will sufficiently ensure our market readiness and confidence of sustaining leadership \\nposition in first line ARV treatment both in APIs and formulations. \\nComing to the developed markets, demand for our broader portfolio remain healthy. In US, we \\ncontinue to get good market share on several products and also increasing volumes.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nDuring H1, we filed one ANDA. Cumulatively, we have filed total 38 ANDAs to-date. Of this, \\nwe have 15 final approvals and 13 tentative approvals so far. \\nWe continue to have diverse portfolio and pipeline including novel 505(b)2 products comprising \\nof ARV, cardiovascular, diabetes, CNS, and gastrointestinal. \\nIn Canada, we have 21 filings with 13 product approvals, of which we have launched nine \\nproducts and we are intending to launch at least two more products during the second-half of \\nFY24. \\nFor EU markets, we have 18 filings with 14 product approvals, of which we already launched \\nsix products. We have continued to strengthen our CMO relationships and anticipate further \\nvolume increases in the coming quarters. \\nOur FDF division continue to operate most of the total commission capacity of 10 billion, in \\nwhich we anticipate that the remaining Brownfield capacities that we added in the last year \\nshould start to get optimally utilized by end of this year. \\nOn R&D front, overall R&D spending to sales for H1 FY24 was at 4.5%. We have incurred little \\nhigher R&D expenditure in this quarter as we acquired intellectual rights for few gene therapy \\nproducts from IIT, Kanpur. \\nWe continue to make good progress and invest in portfolio with product-specific approach based \\non complexity and scale economics. \\nWe have total 62 products in R&D pipeline with market size of over US$ 49 billion. \\nI would like to share the status of our filings as of now; 38 ANDAs in the US, 18 dossiers in \\nEurope, 21 products in Canada, nine dossiers with WSO, eight dossiers in South Africa, one in. \\nAustralia, while 20 dossiers filed in India, while several products were filed in various ROW \\nmarkets. \\nOverall R&D to sales of the full year is expected to be around 4.5%. \\nWhile coming to generic APIs, revenue from generic APIs during the Q2 declined by 8% year-\\non-year to Rs.629 crores. However, sequentially, it has improved by 5%. For H1, overall growth \\nwas flattish. \\nARV retained its volume-led steady momentum through Q2 and revenues moderated a bit, \\nattributing to an element of cyclicality in the ordering. \\nWe continue to maintain a leading market share in the first line HIV treatment-related APIs.\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nIn the onco API space, the sales for the quarter rebounded and delivered a strong revenue \\nincrease over 100% year-on-year to Rs.117 crores. In H1, the growth is over 50%. This is \\nreflective of strong demand across our portfolio and favorable industry dynamics. We are \\naugmenting the new capacity for oncology products to accommodate the increased demand. \\nMore importantly, Laurus Labs, one of the largest high potent API capacities in the country. And \\nour aim to strengthen global leadership in some of the existing products by focusing on higher \\nvolumes and adding new potent molecules. \\nIn the other API segment, which includes cardiovascular, diabetes, asthma has slightly \\nrecovered, tracking only 2% growth quarter-on-quarter to Rs.139 crores. Recovery is muted on \\naccount of temporary market dynamics and scheduling patterns from our partners. On the year-\\non-year basis, revenues declined by 37%. We are confident that underlying demand for our \\nproducts remain strong and our CMO order book has continued to look very healthy. \\nIn first half this financial year, we have filed three DMF, out of those two are in non-ARV \\ncategory. With this company has a total of 83 DMF. \\nWhile coming to synthesis business during the Q2, the company CDMO business recorded \\nrevenues of Rs.224 crores, decline of almost 70% year-on-year. The revenues declined due to a \\nweak year-on-year comparison given large CDMO projects executed last year. Otherwise, the \\nbaseline business tracking healthy and project pipeline continues to scale up very well with our \\nexisting and new customers added in the last six months. \\nWe continue to execute on our scientific-led approach to customer acquisition and retention. We \\nare further strengthening and expanding our relationship with several big pharma. \\nWe remain focused on improving our integrated CDMO enabling technology platform to \\nachieve diversified revenue stream, ensuring stability and resilience. \\nWe are working on over 60 projects, out of this, there are 10 products, commercial, few APIs \\nand several intermediates. \\nWe made good progress on new science for CDMO division, both R&D Center and \\nmanufacturing facilities under LSPL. \\nOur animal health unit initiated commercial validations from this month and should gradually \\nscale up. R&D center is likely to get commissioned by the end of FY24. Our new animal health \\nsite will have all the capabilities to handle steroids, hormones and high potent molecules apart \\nfrom other large volume products. \\nIn Laurus Bio, we recorded strong growth for Q2 and H1; Q2 we grew the revenues by 44% and \\nH1 by 56%. The growth was led by attraction in CDMO services along with the expansion in\\nLaurus Labs Limited \\nOctober 20, 2023 \\n \\nour customer base. We're also optimizing our capacities with the large scale CDMO partners and \\nexpect increased downstream capacity to come on line by December '23. This unit will achieve \\nits peak revenues during FY25. \\nOur enhanced technical expertise and biocatalysis is expanding its application in several small \\nmolecule manufacturing where Laurus is utilizing this expertise to service big pharma. \\nProgress on our new Greenfield site at R3 is on track and we have completed the design phase. \\nWe expect the expansion to happen in a phased manner. This site should further strengthen \\nLaurus capabilities in offering CDMO services in animal origin free proteins and growth factors \\napart from large scale permutation. \\nLet me share brief on quality and EHS initiatives. We have continued to implement and operate \\nbest-in-class R&D, manufacturing and quality control systems in line with the highest global \\nstandards along with a comprehensive EHS management. This is enabled by our profound \\nscientific team of over 2,300 people embracing commitment to evolve to address new \\nopportunities. \\nDuring Q2, we implemented the project called “Sankalp” in association with DuPont \\nSustainability Solutions to further enhance organizational safety excellence. \\nDuring the H1 FY24, a total of 51 quality audits were undertaken, including several customer \\naudits. To-date since inception we have successfully passed 91 regulatory audits, including 40  \\naudits from major global regulatory agencies like USFDA, WHO, PMDA, TGA, EMA and \\nMHRA. \\nWith that, I would like to hand it over to Ravi to share some of the financial highlights.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'speaker': 'V V Ravi Kumar', 'order': 3}, page_content=\"Thank you, Dr. Satya and a very warm welcome to everyone for Q2 and H1 FY24 earnings call. \\nTotal income from operations for the H1 was Rs.2,406 crores as against Rs.3,115 crores. \\nExcluding large PO, you're all aware that we have executed a large PO last year.
